# zink-fhe-src

Source code crate for the Zink-FHE system crate.

This crate contains the logic to build HELib, OpenFHE and SEAL.
It is intended to be consumed by the `zink-fhe-sys` crate.
In theory you aren't interacting with this too much!

## Source

- HELib

```shell
git subrepo clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git helib-src/openssl --branch 7b649c7 --method rebase
```

git config user.email "mark@ckrd.io"
git config user.name "Mark Van de Vyver"

## Versioning

This crate follows the minor and patch versions for each maintained major version, according to:

- The HELib release strategy.
- The OpenFHE release strategy.
- The SEAL release strategy.

The crate versions follow the X.Y.Z+B pattern:

- The major version X is the upstream OpenSSL API/ABI compatibility version:
        300 for 3.Y.Z
- The minor Y and patch Z versions are incremented when making changes to the crate, either upstream update or internal changes.
- `B` contains the full upstream version, like 1.1.1k or 3.0.7. Note that this field is actually ignored in comparisons and only there for documentation.
