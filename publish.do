# if a crate foo depends on bar, a version of bar satisfying
# fooâ€™s requirement must be available in crates.io before
# publishing foo

# dev-dependencies may introduce cyclic dependencies.
# Take the example again that the crate foo depends on bar.
# This time the test cases of bar depend on foo.
# Cargo can resolve these cyclic dependencies because it does not
# need the dev-dependencies to build both foo and bar,
# so it can build bar, foo, and then bar test cases in order.

But cargo publish requires both dependencies and dev-dependencies are available in crates.io, now cyclic dependencies will cause problems.
